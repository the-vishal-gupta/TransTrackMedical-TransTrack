**TransTrack** is a comprehensive, **fully offline**, **HIPAA-compliant** desktop application for transplant operations teams. Built with modern technologies and designed for transplant centers, OPOs, and tissue banks that require regulatory compliance without cloud dependencies.

---

## Why TransTrack Exists

TransTrack was built to address a gap in transplant operations: **operational visibility and readiness risk** that sits outside of national allocation systems.

It focuses on surfacing non-clinical and administrative risks such as expiring evaluations, documentation gaps, and status churn that can quietly place candidates at risk of inactivation.

> **Important Clarification**: TransTrack provides operational prioritization indicators for internal workflow management. It does **not** perform allocation decisions, listing authority functions, or replace UNOS, OPTN, or any national systems.

---

## Who This Is For

TransTrack is intended for:

- **Transplant operations and coordination teams** - Workflow visibility and readiness tracking
- **OPO operations and quality teams** - Documentation and compliance management
- **Clinical informatics and healthcare IT groups** - Secure, offline-first data management
- **Compliance and audit stakeholders** - Immutable audit trails and validation artifacts

**TransTrack is NOT intended for:**

- ❌ Allocation decisions
- ❌ Listing authority
- ❌ Replacement of UNOS, OPTN, or national systems

---

## Core Value: Operational Risk Intelligence

The heart of TransTrack is proactive risk detection that helps teams stay ahead of operational issues:

- **Expiring Evaluations** - Surface candidates with evaluations approaching expiration
- **Documentation Gaps** - Identify missing or stale documentation before it causes problems
- **Status Churn Detection** - Track candidates with frequent status changes that may indicate workflow issues
- **Readiness Barriers** - Track non-clinical operational barriers (insurance, transportation, caregiver support, etc.)
- **Readiness Tracking** - Operational indicators for internal workflow visibility

## Key Features

### Patient Waitlist Management
- Complete patient demographics and medical history
- Operational prioritization indicators aligned with publicly documented concepts, intended solely for internal workflow visibility and readiness tracking (does not perform allocation or listing decisions)
- Real-time waitlist status tracking
- Comprehensive patient search and filtering

### Advanced Donor Matching
- Intelligent donor-recipient compatibility matching
- Blood type compatibility verification
- HLA typing and matching analysis
- Virtual crossmatch simulation
- Predicted graft survival calculations

### Operational Readiness Indicators
- Reference display of publicly documented scoring concepts (MELD, LAS, PRA/CPRA) for informational purposes
- Configurable workflow visibility settings
- Time-on-waitlist tracking for operational awareness
- Internal urgency indicators for workflow prioritization

> **Note**: These indicators are for internal operational visibility only and do not perform or replace official allocation calculations.

### Readiness Barriers (Non-Clinical)
- **Structured barrier tracking** - Pending tests, insurance clearance, transportation, caregiver support, housing, financial clearance
- **Risk-level assignment** - Low, Moderate, High operational risk indicators
- **Team assignment** - Assign barriers to Social Work, Financial, Coordinator, or Other teams
- **Resolution tracking** - Target dates, status updates, and audit history
- **Dashboard integration** - Barriers integrated into Operational Risk Intelligence

> **Important**: Readiness Barriers are strictly NON-CLINICAL, NON-ALLOCATIVE, and designed for operational workflow visibility only. They do NOT affect allocation decisions or replace UNOS/OPTN systems.

### EHR Integration
- **FHIR R4** data import/export
- Patient data synchronization
- Validation rule management
- Import history tracking

### Regulatory Compliance
- **HIPAA** - Full technical safeguard implementation
- **FDA 21 CFR Part 11** - Electronic records compliance
- **AATB Standards** - Tissue banking requirements
- Immutable audit trails
- Role-based access control

### Offline-First Architecture
- **No internet connection required**
- Local encrypted database (AES-256)
- Complete data sovereignty
- Secure backup/restore capabilities

### Enterprise Features
- **Role-Based Access with Audit Justification** - Users must document reasons for accessing sensitive data
- **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity** - Automated backups, verification, and one-click restore
- **Read-Only Compliance View** - Dedicated view for regulators and auditors
- **Offline Degradation with Reconciliation** - Graceful handling of offline scenarios with data sync
